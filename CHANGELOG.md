## CoQui vX.Y.Z [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Notes

- DLR mesh construction changed in this release: DLR checkpoints written by CoQui v0.4.0 or earlier are no longer compatible and must be regenerated. 

### Added

- Imaginary-time and Matsubara meshes to h5 checkpoint, written by both the C++ and the Python IAFT. (#51)
- `CPPDLR` CMake variable to configure against a local cppdlr source tree instead of the one fetched by `FetchContent`. (#51)
- `coqui.post_proc.wannier_weight_plot` and `wannier_weights_on_kpath`: Wannier-interpolated bands along the k-path coloured by the weight of a chosen set of Wannier orbitals, from the `H_skab` written by `band_interpolation`.

### Improved

- More stable DLR mesh construction: `cppdlr` pin bumped from `f6bd6ab` to `7a0f60c`. (#51)
- IAFT mesh compatibility checking when reading a checkpoint. (#51)
- `downfold_2e` with `screen_type = "crpa_ks"` or `"crpa_vasp"` now reports the bands selected for the active-space polarization at each k-point, their Wannier weights, the selection margin, and warns when the ranking is nearly tied; ties are broken deterministically toward the lower band index.

### Default Value Updates

- Default imaginary-axis window: `wmax = 1.5 * [(emax - emin) + max(emax - ef, ef - emin)]`, sized for the `Sigma = G*W` convolution, instead of `wmax = 1.5 * max(emax - ef, ef - emin)`. (#56)

## CoQui v0.4.0 [2026-09-21]

### Added

- Grand potential and the derived thermodynamic properties (Helmholtz free energy, entropy, electron number) from a Dyson-SCF solution, enabled by `eval_thermodynamics` (default `false`). Available for HF and GW; not yet implemented for GF2. (#38)
- `COQUI_FFT_BACKEND` to select the FFT implementation explicitly: `FFTW` (default, real FFTW3) or `MKL`. (#43)
- `calc_type` in `post_proc.band_plot` to plot the band structure of a DMFT-type calculation: `"dmft"` reads the `embed` group, `"mbpt"` (default) the `scf` group. (#58)

### Improved

- GW+EDMFT bosonic causal projection is now configured per fit target (`Wloc`, `U_weiss`, impurity), each with its own bath count and its own number of excluded low-frequency Matsubara points (see API Updates). (#58)
- GW+EDMFT parameter handling and input validation. (#39)
- `fft_lib` is built as a shared library under `COQUI_PYTHON_SUPPORT`, so all c2py modules bind `fftw_*` to a single FFT implementation. (#43)
- Consistent HDF5 library usage: using the public `HDFArchive` API instead of the private `h5._h5py` binding. (#39)
- `.gitignore` coverage. (#57)

### Fixed

- Compilation error from a duplicate `c2py` target. (#55, issue #52)
- Compilation error from the `roundup` macro conflict in SLATE. (#42, icl-utk-edu/slate#227)
- Crash in `make_thc_coulomb` under Python from FFTW/MKL symbol interposition. (#43)
- `dyson_scf_gw_diis_vs_damping` failing depending on the BLAS/LAPACK implementation: the imaginary-axis window is widened to cover the spectrum and the references regenerated. (#54, issue #53)
- MPI broadcast of the effective-Hamiltonian path in Wannier interpolation. (#39)
- `NameError` in `solve_impurities_from_chkpt` when `degenerate_blk` is set. (#39)
- Cast `n_warmup_cycles` to `int` before reaching the impurity solver in the auxiliary chemical-potential search. (#39)
- `plot_edmft_convergence` on checkpoints with an incomplete impurity iteration. (#39)
- `read_last_it.py` now preserves the `Format` attribute of serialized TRIQS objects, so a trimmed checkpoint can still be reconstructed on read. (#58)

### API Updates

- `ENABLE_FFTW` is removed; use `COQUI_FFT_BACKEND=FFTW|MKL` instead. (#43)
- GW+EDMFT `causal_projection`: `nbath_per_orbital`, `exclude_w0` and `target` are replaced by the per-target keys `nbath_per_orbital_{wloc,u_weiss,impurity}` (default `-1` = skip that fit) and `n_exclude_low_freq_{wloc,u_weiss,impurity}` (default `0`). (#58)
- `dmft.bath_fit.causal_projection_boson` takes `nbath_per_orbital` and `n_exclude_low_freq` as explicit arguments instead of a `causal_params` dict. (#58)
- `scf_loop` takes a trailing `eval_thermodynamics` flag. (#38)

### Default Value Updates

- EDMFT impurity mixing: `mix_in_first_iter` default changed to `True` (from `False`). (#39)

## CoQui v0.3.0 [2026-06-03]

### Added

- DIIS for QP-SCF via new `qp_com_diis_residual` and `vspace_heff` classes, with unit tests covering both Dyson- and QP-SCF paths.
- New double-bisection chemical-potential search algorithm robust for insulators (finds the middle of the acceptable μ window rather than the first crossing), and a midpoint algorithm for QP-SCF. The algorithm is externally selectable via `mu_update_alg`.
- Unified analytic-continuation interface (`ac`) with five backends:
  - CoQui Pade (C++ implementation).
  - TRIQS Pade.
  - AAA algorithm via the adapol library.
  - Minipole via the mini_pole library.
  - `maxent_triqs` analytic-continuation via TRIQS MaxEnt.
- Python wrapper around the C++ logger.
- EDMFT convergence metrics (Weiss field, `|Gloc - Gimp|`, `|Wloc - Wimp|`) are stored in the EDMFT checkpoint, with utility functions to visualize them.

### Improved

- DIIS is now the default iterative solver for both Dyson-SCF and QP-SCF.
- Shared chemical-potential search implementation between Dyson-SCF and QP-SCF, with improved log output.
- `simple_dyson::compute_eigenspectra` refactored to exploit Hermitian symmetry.
- GW+EDMFT driver refactor: docstrings and sensible defaults across `gw_edmft` routines.
- Hermitian symmetry enforced on upfolded self-energies, impurity solutions, and `Delta_tau` / `D0_tau` preparations.
- EDMFT convergence checks moved fully to the imaginary-time axis.
- Improved GW+EDMFT logging: prints `|Gloc - Gimp|`, `|Wloc - Wimp|`, A(ω=0) proxy via `Gloc(β/2)`, and tail-fit setup.
- Suppressed ct-seg solver output during `mu_imp` search; improved `mu_imp` log output.
- `band_plot` and `spectral_plot` are importable directly from the `post_proc` submodule.
- Extract QP energies from Dyson-SCF checkpoint as a post-processing utility.
- Docstring pass for the Python IAFT module.
- `read_last_iter.py` retains only the last iteration.
- MBPT and Wannier90 routines now support explicit `outdir` parameter for consistent checkpoint and output file path handling.
  - MBPT: Simplified path resolution logic. Uses legacy `output` key if present and non-empty, otherwise constructs path as `outdir + "/" + prefix` with `outdir` default of `"./"`.
  - Wannier90: Added explicit `outdir` parameter to all public entrypoints (`to_wannier90`, `wannier90_library_mode`, `wannier90_library_mode_from_nnkp`, `append_wannier90_win`, `mlwf_h5_from_wannier90_output`). Output files are consistently placed at `outdir + "/" + prefix` with `outdir` default of `"./"`.
  - Updated all corresponding Python wrapper docstrings and examples to document the new `outdir` parameter and expected file locations.
- TRIQS compatibility: `triqs.gf` → `triqs.gfs`, updated function names from `triqs.modest`. `c2py` pinned to a known-good commit while upstream stabilizes.
- Refactored the TRIQS MaxEnt analytic-continuation interface in `post_proc/analytic_cont.py`.
- Imaginary-part tolerance warnings for `Nelec` and the correlation energy now scale with the IAFT `eps` rather than using fixed thresholds.
- Regenerated Python binding (`.wrap`) files that are compatible with c2py (2f7f21dd56ff2161299194313c6f1fb600d52a7c).

### Fixed

- Iterative-solver path when disabled in `dmft_embed`.
- Compilation error when BUILD_UNIT_TESTS is disabled.

### API Updates

- Python IAFT: renamed `ir_notation` to `phys_notation` (now a keyword-only argument).
- GW+EDMFT: `wmax` and `eps` inputs for the EDMFT subspace are consolidated under the `iaft` dictionary.
- GW+EDMFT: restart now requires an existing checkpoint.
- ct-seg interface updated for the upstream TRIQS rename of `nn_nu` to `nn_nu_dlr` (`measure_nn_nu` → `measure_nn_nu_dlr`).

### Default Value Updates

- Updated IAFT defaults:
  - default basis changed to `dlr` (from `ir`) for both `iaft.basis` and legacy `iaft_basis` interfaces.
  - default `prec` changed to `medium` (from `high`) when `eps` is not provided.
- Updated THC defaults:
  - default `ecut` changed to `1.4 * mf->ecutwfc()` if wavefunction fft grid is available, otherwise to `0.4 * mf->ecutrho()`.
  - default `thresh` changed to `1e-5` (from `1e-10`).
  - when `nIpts` is set and `thresh` is not explicitly provided, `thresh` is auto-resolved to `1e-13` to avoid premature termination before reaching requested `nIpts`.

## CoQui v0.2.0 [2026-02-04]

### Added

- Fully self-consistent GW+EDMFT solver and interface, including the new `dmft` Python submodule (`src/python/dmft/`), drivers, utilities (bath fitting, chemical potential, checkpoints, SCF driver, etc.)
- TRIQS CT-SEG interface (planned to be moved to the TRIQS library in the future).
- New examples for cRPA and GW+EDMFT.
- Unit test for Wannier90 MLWF workflow using SrVO3.
- `mlwf_h5_from_wannier90_output` utility to read Wannier90 output files and write MLWF data into CoQui h5 format.

### Improved

- Major refactor for downfolding routines to improve the API, enhance modularity, and increase code readability.
- Downfolded Coulomb interactions are now stored under `downfolded_model` h5 group within the input h5 group, e.g. `scf/iter{}` or `embed/iter{}`.
- `IAFT` initialization from CoQui checkpoint h5.
- Improved TRIQS ModEST interface for quantum embedding.
- Improved SCF runtime controls: added `iter_alg.enable` to optionally disable iterative mixing/DIIS paths, added `mu_tolerance` for explicit chemical-potential convergence control, and added stricter checkpoint/input dataset validation for `greens_func_source`/`greens_func_iteration` workflows.
- Examples for MLWF library and standalone modes.
- Examples for Fourier transform on imaginary time/frequency grids on Python.
- Chol-GW for molecules refactoring.
- Improved divergence treatment for dielectric function, and a customized option for metallic systems. The previous default `gygi` is now an alias for `gygi_smallest_q` for backward compatibility.

### Fixed

- Wannier90 compilation issue due to recent updates in Wannier90 codebase. 

### API Updates

- Renamed MBPT/downfolding input keys from `input_type` and `input_iter` to `greens_func_source` and `greens_func_iteration`.
- Renamed `downfold_local_coulomb` to `downfold_coulomb` to reflect support for non-local downfolded interactions.

## CoQui v0.1.0 [2026-01-23]

- ISDF auxiliary basis can now be written on reduced or full FFT mesh via `write_zeta_on_fft_mesh` parameter.
- Refactored Python interfaces for interaction and mean-field modules.
- Updated `README.md`, example documentation and docstring.

### Fixed

- Various bug fixes in PySCF interface and import logic.

### Removed

- Deprecated and redundant example input files and pseudopotentials.
